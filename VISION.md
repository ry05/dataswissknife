# Our Vision

**Data Science is Important.** It is no longer a discipline tucked away in research literature and neither is its scope limited to business use cases. Everybody ranging from 16 year olds to academic practitioners and from policy regulators to the tech giants, have all begun tapping the potential of data to improve their decisions.  

Writing code has now become synonymous with data science. This is never a bad thing, however we feel that this constraint of having to be able to write code in order to begin with data science creates a rather tall barrier in the start of a non-data person's journey. Sometimes, even seasoned players of the data game find themselves in a spot of bother when they need to do a lot of coding at first to even generate the most preliminary results. We wish to provide some help here through DataSwissKnife(DSK).  

The DSK vision is rather simple - *"Help people do data science better"*. We believe that the results of a good data-driven project should be more dependent on the ability of the user's domain expertise and be less constrained by the code written. The term **"domain expertise"** signifies the relevant information a given user has with respect to the dataset he or she is analysing. The kinds of information a user needs to know about their the concerned dataset include:

* What is the data about? Why is the data being analysed?
* What features does the dataset contain? What are the expected data types of these features(i.e numerical or non-numerical)?
* And more ...

## Do we feel writing code is unimportant?

**Nope.** The purpose of DSK is to not negate the necessity of writing code. It is only aimed at helping the user generate preliminary results without having to write code, for complex analysis it is always important for the user to write their code(atleast for nowüòè)

## Is DSK a silver bullet for data science projects?

**Nope.** Not a claim we can make yetüòè
